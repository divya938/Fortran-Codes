# Fortran-Codes
The dipolemoment and polarizations can be calculated from the lammpstrajectory using this fortran code for each stack (one dimensional supramolecular polymers aligned in z-axis). The output is xvg files. 

command line : ./polarization.sh <electric-field_value in v/A> "'<lammpsdump filename>'"
